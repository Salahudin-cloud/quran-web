# Project Ramadhan 2024 
Welcome to the Ramadan 2024 project, a groundbreaking endeavor marking my maiden voyage into Laravel development. This Al-Quran web application stands as a testament to my dedication and newfound skills in web development. Within this repository, you'll find a meticulously crafted platform designed to serve the spiritual needs of users, offering a comprehensive catalog of the Quran, detailed explanations for each surah, verse-by-verse tafsir, and immersive audio recitations for every chapter. 
## What I Use
- laravel [v10.47.0](https://laravel.com/)
- Al Quran API from [here](https://github.com/renomureza/quran-api-id)
